        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a software engineer and recent graduate of Rutgers University - New Brunswick where I majored in Computer
          Science and minored in Economics. Currently, I'm working full-time at AT&T as a member of their
          Technology Development Program!
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of sharpening my skills as a developer, I love to spend my time playing video games. Whether it be
          League of Legends, Super Smash Bros., or even Pokemon Go, you can usually find me enjoying a game with friends
          or
          family.

            <p>During my internship at this NYC startup, I designed initial website mockups by wireframing using Adobe
              Illustrator and Photoshop, and wrote PaperJS scripts to create clothing patterns. I also conducted market
